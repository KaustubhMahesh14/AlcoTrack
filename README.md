# AlcoTrack
Commercial vehicle drivers tend to indulge in alcohol consumption, which leads to high risk of road accidents and is a threat to drivers’ own safety. Other than that, drowsy drivers also have the tendency to doze off at the wheel. Sleepy drivers risk injury and death, not only from falling asleep while driving but also from loss of attention or slowing of reactions during critical driving tasks or maneuvers. Our approach to solving this kind of problem would be to deploy nanosensors in the steering wheel of the car which measures blood alcohol level from the driver’s sweat and also a pressure sensor, which measures the pressure applied on the steering, to make sure the car is being driven under normal conditions. We will be building a mobile app where data will be sent. If the blood alcohol level is higher than a certain value and very less or no pressure is sensed on the steering, then an alert will be created in the app,which will advice the driver to stop driving and a message along with location regarding the same will be delivered to the emergency contacts.
